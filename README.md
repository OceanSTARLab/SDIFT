(This repo is still on update)

This is authors' official PyTorch implementation for paper:"**Generating Full-field Evolution of Physical Dynamics from Irregular Sparse Observations**"[[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09284)].




---
## Key Idea
Generating ***Continous Spatiotemporal Multidimensional Physical Data*** with Functional Tucker Model, GP-based Sequential Diffusion and Message-Passing Posterior Sampling.

## Requirements:
The project is mainly built with **pytorch 2.3.0** under **python 3.10**. The detailed package info can be found in `requirement.txt`.

## Instructions:
1. Clone this repository.
2. To play with the model quickly, we offer several notebooks at `notebook`(on activate matter data)
3. The project primarily consists of three `.py` files, **which should be executed in the following order:** 

- **`train_FTM.py`**  
  Trains the Functional Tucker Model using physical data and outputs shared latent functions along with batches of core tensors.

- **`train_GPSD.py`**  
  Trains the GP-based Sequential Diffusion Model using the batches of core tensors obtained from the first step.

- **`message_passing_DPS.py`**  
  Reconstructs the entire field from sparse observations using our proposed Message-Passing DPS algorithm.


4. Tune the (hyper)parameters of model in the corresponding `.py` file.
5. To apply the model on your own dataset, please follow the  `preprocessing_data.py` file to process the raw data into appropriate format.
6. GPU choice: the models are run on CPU by default, but you can change the device to CPU by modifying the `device` in the correponding file


<!-- ## Data

We offer the **raw data**,  **processed data** and **processed scripts** for all three datasets used in paper. Given the large size of  *Solar-Power* and *Uber-Move*, we put them in the [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KtxKwGaUAFnKWXwjUzjZ64hmYlda2Qtl?usp=sharing).

The code for generating the synthetic data is also provided in the [notebook]( https://github.com/xuangu-fang/BayOTIDE/blob/master/data/process_script/gen_simu.ipynb).


If you wanna customize your own data to play the model, please follow the notebooks in `data/process_script/`. -->
